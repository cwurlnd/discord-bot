# discord-bot

Every once in a while, when my friends and I hop online to play some games together, we are left with one big question:
What game should we play?

It shouldn't be too difficult of a descision since we don't have too many games to choose from, but the fact that options exist poses a problem of decision-making.

Sure, we could use the following method:

But I had a better idea: make a Discord Bot.
Considering we use Discord anyway to talk to each other, it would make sense that we use it to help decide what game to play!

Hence, WurlBot was created. I used the following to make the bot:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Discord API

My friends and I can now argue over the game the bot chooses, rather than a game that one of us chooses!
